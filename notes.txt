Adding files to .gitignore:
echo "geckodriver.log" >> .gitignore

Putting geckodriver in PATH:
cd ~/.local/bin
cp ~/Desktop/data-science/times_scraper/webdriver_installations/geckodriver-v0.25.0-linux64/geckodriver .
cp ~/Desktop/data-science/times_scraper/webdriver_installations/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver .
echo 'PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

Make a folder as module so that files can be imported:
add a file __init__.py. This will make the folder "importable". Now objects, modules can be imported from it.
Also, need to set the PYTHONPATH variable.

Setting PYTHONPATH:
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
